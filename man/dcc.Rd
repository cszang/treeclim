\value{
'dcc' returns an 'object' of class '"tc_dcc"'.
  
  The functions 'summary' and 'plot' are used to obtain and print
  a summary of the results, and to create a plot. The function
  'coef' can be used to extract the coefficients.
  
  An object of class '"tc_dcc"' is a list containing at least the
  following components:
  
  \item{call}{the call made to function 'dcc'}
  
  \item{coef}{the coefficients, themselves being an object of
  class 'tc_coef' for the static case, and of class 'tc_mcoef' for
  the moving case. Objects of class 'tc_coef' are single
  data.frames, while objects of class 'tc_mcoef' are lists of
  seperate data.frames for the coefficients (element 'coef'), upper and
  lower confidence interval (elements 'ci_upper' and 'ci_lower'), and
  significance flags (element 'significant')}
  
  \item{design}{the design matrix on which this call to 'dcc'
  operates}
  
  \item{truncated}{the input data truncated to the common timespan
  or the specified timespan}
  
  \item{original}{the original input data, with the climate data
  being recast into a single data.frame}
}
\description{
This function calculates (potentially moving or evolving) response
and correlation functions from tree-ring chronologies and monthly
climatic data.  For the moving case, the calculation is performed
repeatedly for consecutive time windows. Function parameters may
be bootstrapped to calculate their significance and confidence
intervals.
}
\details{
This function builds upon and extents the functionality of
programme DENDROCLIM2002 (Biondi and Waikul, 2004), and will
calculate bootstrapped (and non-bootstrapped) moving and static
response and correlation functions in a similar fashion as
described in the above mentioned paper. Important extensions
include a very flexible parameter selection model (see below), the
possibility to use an unlimited number of climate parameters, and
the option to use exact bootstrapping.
  
Input chronology data can be a \code{data.frame} such as produced
by function \code{chron} of package dplR. It has to be a
\code{data.frame} with at least one column containing the
tree-ring indices, and the corresponding years as \code{rownames}.
  
For climatic input data, there are three possibilities: Firstly,
input climatic data can be a \code{data.frame} or \code{matrix}
consisting of at least 3 rows for years, months and at least one
climate parameter in the given order. Secondly, input climatic
data can be a single \code{data.frame} or \code{matrix} in the
style of the original DENDROCLIM2002 input data, i.e. one
parameter with 12 months in one row, where the first column
represents the year. Or thirdly, input climatic data can be a
(potentially named) list of one or several of the latter described
\code{data.frame} or \code{matrices}. If named list is provided,
potentially provided variable names through argument
\code{var_names} are ignored. As an internal format dispatcher
checks the format automatically, it is absolutely necessary that
in all three cases, only complete years (months 1-12) are
provided. It is not possible to mix different formats in one go.
  
Parameters can be selected with the 'selection' parameter in two
different ways:

\itemize{
\item simple selections: as an example -6:9 selects from all
  climate variables all months from previous year's June (-6,
  previous year's months are specified as negative integers) to
  current years September (9, months of the current year are
  specified as positive integers) as model parameters. Months from
  the previous year and the year before that can be selected using
  \link{treeclim-shifters} like \code{..(6)} to refer to July of
  the year before the previous year.

\item using \emph{modifiers}: More complex parameter selections
  can be obtained by the \emph{modifiers} provided in treeclim:
  \code{.range}, \code{.mean}, and \code{.sum}. These modifiers
  can also be chained to create complex selections. See
  \link{treeclim-modifiers} for details.
}

For the exclusion of months, the convenience function
\code{\link{exclude_from}} (or short \code{\link{exfr}}) is
provided.
  
1000 bootstrap samples are taken from the original distributions
of climate and tree-ring data, either using the stationary
bootstrap (Politis and Romano 1994, \code{boot = "stationary"}) or
classical bootstrap (DENDROCLIM2002-style, \code{boot =
"std"}). The stationary bootstrap mimics the stationary properties
of the original time series in the resampled time series by
resampling within blocks. Within each block, the number of
observations is random and has a geometric distribution.
Consequently, the choice of the distribution parameter will affect
the autocorrelation structure of the resampled time
series. Optimal (expected) block length is chosen according to
Politis and White (2004). In the case of response function
analysis, an eigen decomposition of the standardized predictor
matrix is performed. Nonrelevant eigenvectors are removed using
the PVP criterion (Guiot, 1990), principal component scores are
then calculated from the matrices of reduced eigenvectors and
standardized climatic predictors. Response coefficients are found
via singular value decomposition, and tested for significance
using the 95\% percentile range method (Dixon, 2001). In case of
correlation function analysis, the coefficients are Pearson's
correlation coefficients. The same method for significance testing
is applied.
  
There is also the option to use exact bootstrapping like
implemented in seascorr (Meko et al. 2011, \code{boot =
"exact"}). In this case, circulant embedding is used to simulate
the tree-ring data 1000 times as time series with the same
frequency characteristics like the original time-series (Percival
& Constantine, 2006). Empirical non-exceedence probabilities are
used to test the coefficients of the response/correlation function
with the original data for significance. For the exact
bootstrapping case, no confidence intervals for the
response/correlation coefficients can be computed.
